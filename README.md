## Commit conventions
We use <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/"> Conventional Commits</a>.

1. Ideally divide commit into **title** and **body**
    - Use the following structure:
      - ```<type>: <description> [optional body]```
  
2. Specify **commit type** and follow with ':'
    - **feat** – a new feature is introduced with the changes
    - **fix** – a bug fix has occurred
    - **refactor** – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - **docs** – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
    - **style** – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
  
3. Use **imperative** in title
4. **DO NOT** capitalize title nor use punctuation for title
5. Length of commit title has to be **no more than 50 characters**
